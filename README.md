# RedNeckSnailSpit

Welcome to my humble slice of GitHub!  
I'm a Full Stack Developer (mostly for fun), wrangling web tech like PHP, JS, CSS, HTML, and backend wizardry with Python and MariaDB/MySQL (MariaDB is my go-to).  
Occasionally, I dabble in Lua (thanks, ComputerCraft!) or the Python-like language from _The Farmer Was Replaced_—because why not?

---

## My Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** PHP, Python, MariaDB/MySQL
- **Sporadic Ventures:** Lua (ComputerCraft), game scripting

---

## Open Source Enthusiast
I live for open source. No favorite projects—just a fan of anything open and collaborative!  
Some of my go-tos:
- [Pterodactyl](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel)
- The *arr Stack (Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, etc.)
- [JellyFin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin)
- [ISPConfig](https://github.com/ispconfig/ispconfig3)
- [Akaunting](https://github.com/akaunting/akaunting)

Check out my own repositories for web stuff, fun experiments, and whatever else I feel like hacking on:
- [kawakawa_web](https://github.com/RedNeckSnailSpit/kawakawa_web)
- [kawakawa_services](https://github.com/RedNeckSnailSpit/kawakawa_services)
